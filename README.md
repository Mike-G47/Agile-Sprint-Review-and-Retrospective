How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?  <br/>
  The way we interpret user needs in this case was by setting up a group interview with some of the customers and listening to some of the features that each end user would like to see. I empathize with each user 
  to understand why those features may be important and then break them up into user stories. User stories help with this by creating goals for the team to work on while being as clear as possible. We make sure the
  each user story is clear by using the format of “As a(n) <type of user>, I want to <perform some task>, So that I can <achieve some goal>”.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?  <br/>
  the way I would approach developing a program is by breaking down development into Sprints. Each Sprint would have a well define backlog with User Stories that lets the team know exactly what they should be working on.
  We will ensure that the team has clear work to do by having a Daily Scrum meeting in which the team communicates and attempts to answer key questions such as "What did I do yesterday to help meet the Sprint Goal?" 
  "What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal?" and "What impedes us from meeting the Sprint Goal.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? <br/>
  To be a good team member in software development mean that you need to be communicative, adaptable, and proactive. A development team strives off of collaberation so it is important to engage with your teammates whether 
  that be attending daily scrums or sending emails when you need clarification on a task. Adaptability is important because most project dont always go as planned and some changes may occur during development. One should
  anticipate issues before they arise and take the innitiative to fix them.
